# Random-Navier-Stokes
JuliaLang simulations and visualizations of random Navier Stokes equations

Use main.jl to call functions in helpers/mainComputations.jl and helpers/animations.jl
Some editing in helpers/animations.jl may be required

Todo:
- Add a "lock" to output folders so that the output does not get rewritten
- Add functionality to continue simulations for additional runs
- Add more metadata to output files so it is easy to recreate simulations (specific metadata file?)
