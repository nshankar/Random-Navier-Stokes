# Random-Navier-Stokes

**Author**: Nikhil Shankar

JuliaLang simulations and visualizations of random Navier Stokes equations.

Simple Use: First generate the desired initial conditions using **`generateInitialConditions.jl`**. Then edit and run **`main.jl`** on those initial conditions. To promote encapsulation, users are encouraged to call functions in **`helpers/mainComputations.jl`** and **`helpers/animations.jl`** as much as possible.
